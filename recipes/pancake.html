    <h5>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think.</h5>
    <p>This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients <br> that are probably  already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below:</p>
    <h4>Ingredient:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Baking Powder</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt <br>and ensure the ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg and then add the buttermilk, regular milk, and melted butter <br>then mix the wet ingredients until well combined.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour the wet ingredients into it. Gently stir <br> until just combined, being careful not to overmix. A few lumps in the batter are okay.</li>
        <li>Preheat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil <br>to coat the surface.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup portions of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form <br>on the surface and the edges look set, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown <br> then repeat with the remaining batter</li>
    </ol>
